## UAT-10 · Free Tier Limit & Paywall

**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Precondition:** Not yet upgraded to Premium. Fresh vault (or reset).  
**Note (v4.0):** Free tier limit is now **5 documents** (reduced from 10). All hardcoded references in UI use the `FREE_TIER_DOCUMENT_LIMIT` constant — verify the number shown in-app matches 5.  
**Note (v6.0):** Premium status is now stored in SecureStore with HMAC tamper detection. The cached status is verified against a signed hash — manually tampering with the SecureStore value will not bypass the paywall.

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10.1 | Add documents until 4 are in the vault | Each document adds normally | ☐ |
| 10.2 | Open Add Document modal with 4 documents stored | Free tier banner shows "1 of 5 free documents remaining" | ☐ |

| 10.5 | Verify paywall headline | "You've reached the free limit of 5 documents." | ☐ |
| 10.6 | Dismiss paywall | Returns to document library; no document added; still 5 documents | ☐ |
| 10.7 | Open Settings → Subscription section | Shows "Free" status and "Upgrade to Premium" amber button | ☐ |
| 10.8 | Tap "Upgrade to Premium" in Settings | Paywall appears with `settings` trigger | ☐ |

## UAT-11 · In-App Purchase — Premium Upgrade (Lifetime)

**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Precondition:** Sandbox tester account signed in on device (Settings → App Store → Sandbox Account). Both IAP products created in App Store Connect.  
**Note (v4.0):** The paywall has been fully rebuilt. See UAT-30 for detailed paywall UX verification. This suite covers the lifetime purchase flow specifically.  
**Note (v6.0):** Products are cached for 1 hour (TTL = 3,600,000ms). After 1 hour, StoreKit is re-queried. Premium status is persisted in SecureStore with HMAC signing for tamper resistance.

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11.1 | Open paywall from any trigger (Settings or document limit) | Paywall opens with Lifetime card displayed **first and prominently** as the hero product | ☐ |

| 11.12 | Sign out from sandbox account; sign back in | — | ☐ |

### Product Cache TTL

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Result |

## UAT-12 · Family Kit Creation

**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Precondition:** Premium account. **At least 1 document in vault** — the wizard immediately dismisses with an Alert if the vault is empty (see UAT-34).  
**Note (v5.0):** The kit wizard now guards against an empty vault at entry. If triggered with zero documents, the user sees an alert and is returned to the dashboard. Test that guard in UAT-34.  
**Note (v6.0):** The generating step now shows "Processing document X of Y…" progress text. See UAT-38 for dedicated progress coverage.

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Result |

**Precondition:** A valid `.afterme` file and its QR code (from UAT-12) are available. Use a second device or fresh install.  
**Note (v3.0):** The survivor flow no longer shows a bereavement support step at the end. After the vault imports successfully, the flow ends at the vault intro screen with an "Open the Vault" button. No external support links appear.  
**Note (v6.0):** "I Have a Legacy Kit" now passes a `legacy_kit` mode to the survivor screen, distinct from the `restore_vault` mode used by "Restore My Vault". If QR scanning fails, a manual key entry option is available (Fix 14).

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Precondition:** Premium account. At least 3 documents in vault. Onboarding complete.  
**Note:** This test covers internal security improvements in v1.0.1 — key zeroing after use, AAD (Additional Authenticated Data) binding, and atomic vault operations. While these are largely invisible to the end user, regression testing confirms they don't break existing flows.

### Key Rotation & Session Eviction

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Result |
|---|---|---|---|

| 35.2 | Open a document and verify it displays | Document content renders correctly (encryption keys working) | ☐ |

|---|---|---|---|
| 35.9 | Begin adding a document (select source, pick category) | Add Document modal is open | ☐ |
| 35.10 | While the import is processing, force-close the app | App terminates mid-import | ☐ |
| 35.11 | Reopen and authenticate | Vault loads without corruption | ☐ |
| 35.12 | Run vault integrity check | All previously saved documents pass. The interrupted import either completed atomically or was cleanly rolled back — no partial/corrupt entries. | ☐ |

### Premium Tamper Resistance

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 35.13 | Verify premium status is active | Settings → Subscription shows premium | ☐ |
| 35.14 | Force-close app, clear app cache (not app data) via device settings | — | ☐ |
| 35.15 | Reopen app and authenticate | Premium status is still active (persisted in SecureStore, not cache) | ☐ |

| 36.18 | Enter a valid Document Date but leave Expiry Date empty | Document saves with only Document Date set | ☐ |
| 36.19 | Enter an invalid date and attempt to save (tap confirm button) | Save is blocked; error message remains on the invalid field | ☐ |
| 36.20 | Correct the error and save | Document saves successfully | ☐ |
| 36.21 | Verify max input length | Date fields accept at most 10 characters (DD/MM/YYYY) | ☐ |
